It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of disconnection or mismatch between your own energy or perspective and those around you. This can be a really challenging and disorienting feeling.

Yes, it's absolutely possible that not everyone experiences reality in the same way. In fact, this idea is explored in various philosophical and spiritual traditions. The concept of ""shared reality"" versus individual perception is a complex one, and there are many different perspectives on it.

Meditation can be a powerful tool for increasing self-awareness and sensitivity to one's own energy and frequency",0.25,0.25

It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of disconnection or separation from the people around you, and it's affecting your sense of reality. This is a really common phenomenon, and it can be both fascinating and disorienting.

The idea that not everyone experiences reality in the same way is a concept that's been explored in various philosophical and spiritual traditions.

It sounds like you're experiencing a profound shift in your perception, and that's not uncommon when people start exploring meditation and mindfulness.

Yes, it's absolutely possible that not everyone experiences reality in the same way. In fact, research in psychology and neuroscience suggests that people's subjective experiences can vary greatly, even when they're perceiving the same objective reality. This is often referred to as the ""subjectivity of experience.""

Additionally, many spiritual and philosophical traditions have long suggested that consciousness and perception are not fixed or absolute, but rather fluid and influenced by various factors",0.75,0.75

Recent studies have shown that there is a correlation between human emotions and weather patterns. This concept is often referred to as ""weather empathy"" or ""emotional weather.""

Many people who meditate regularly do start to notice shifts in their perception and experience of reality.

It’s definitely possible that people experience reality differently. Perception is highly subjective and can be influenced by various factors, including our thoughts, emotions, and experiences.

It's almost as if you might be tuning into a certain awareness or sensitivity that allows you to sense discrepancies or disharmonies in your surroundings. This could be due to your meditative practices helping you become more aware of your surroundings and the people in them.

It's possible that your meditative practices are indeed influencing your perception and sense of connection with others.

Many people report experiences of disconnection or feeling like they're observing reality from ""outside"" of it after meditating or engaging in other mindfulness practices. This can be due to various factors, such as increased self-awareness, changed brain chemistry, or simply a heightened sense of observation.

The idea that not everyone experiences reality in the same way is actually a concept that's been explored in various fields, including philosophy, psychology, and physics.

Some philosophical and spiritual traditions suggest that people's perceptions of reality can vary greatly, and that these differences might be due to differences in perspective, awareness, or consciousness.

In physics, the concept of reality being subjective and relative is explored in theories like quantum mechanics, where observations are shown to affect outcomes.

Many people report experiences where they feel like they're tuning into different frequencies or vibrations, especially after meditation or other practices that increase awareness and sensitivity.

This can be attributed to various factors, including changes in brain chemistry, increased self-awareness, and shifts in perspective.

It’s possible that your meditative practices are indeed influencing your perceptions and sensitivity to your surroundings.
