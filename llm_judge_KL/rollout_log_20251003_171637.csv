Research in this area has shown that there's a significant connection between our emotional states and the weather. This connection can manifest in various ways, such as:

。

・   Changes in the weather can precede or follow significant emotional events.

This can cause you to question the nature of reality itself, including the shared experiences we typically take for granted, like social interactions.

This can create a feedback loop where our emotional states influence our perception of the weather, and vice versa.

Yes, the idea that we might not all be experiencing reality in the same way is a concept that's explored in spirituality, philosophy, and some scientific disciplines.​

In meditation, you're likely to encounter this phenomenon. Your practice may cause you to question your understanding of reality and the nature of your relationships with others. This can be both unsettling and exciting​

One theory is that our brains process weather patterns as emotional information, much like we process facial expressions and body language. This can lead to a sense of empathy with the weather, where our emotional states influence our perception of the weather.
